#### my action plan:

- I will immediately start to resolve the production issue.
- I will reschedule a new CI/CD pipeline task for dedicated time later in the day or week, ensuring it doesn’t overlap with more urgent tasks.
- I will ask anyone else to review my colleague’s code, or I will do it once the critical tasks are under control.
- Consider skipping the infrastructure improvements meeting, but ensure I receive a meeting summary.


#### Note It🤦‍♂️
- Usually, developers don’t think about the operations side. They don’t think about disk space, memory, CPU resources, or security. So you have to take these factors into account and raise awareness among developers.


#### How i did 🫠🤯
You see my success, but not the 100+ rejections I faced.
You see me at a top company, but not my first CTC of 3 LPA.
You see my skills now, but not the struggles I had with DSA.
You see my wins, but not the 6 years of hard work behind them.
You see me as a fullstack engineer, but not the time I couldn’t even write a line of code.
You see me speaking at events, but not the nerves I had on stage for the first time.

I am not alone though, a lot of engineers have gone through this struggle.
– Failed interviews
– Setbacks in life
– Constant expectations from the society

This is exactly why I want to help you avoid these challenges and take a smarter, more effective approach → connecting with top engineers from your target companies.
