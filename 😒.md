#### my action plan:

- I will immediately start to resolve the production issue.
- I will reschedule a new CI/CD pipeline task for dedicated time later in the day or week, ensuring it doesn’t overlap with more urgent tasks.
- I will ask anyone else to review my colleague’s code, or I will do it once the critical tasks are under control.
- Consider skipping the infrastructure improvements meeting, but ensure I receive a meeting summary.


#### Note It🤦‍♂️
- Usually, developers don’t think about the operations side. They don’t think about disk space, memory, CPU resources, or security. So you have to take these factors into account and raise awareness among developers.
