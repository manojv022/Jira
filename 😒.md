#### my action plan:

- I will immediately start to resolve the production issue.
- I will reschedule a new CI/CD pipeline task for dedicated time later in the day or week, ensuring it doesn’t overlap with more urgent tasks.
- I will ask anyone else to review my colleague’s code, or I will do it once the critical tasks are under control.
- Consider skipping the infrastructure improvements meeting, but ensure I receive a meeting summary.
